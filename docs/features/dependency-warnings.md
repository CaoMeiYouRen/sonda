# Dependency warnings

::: warning
This feature is currently only available in the `html` format report. Support for the `json` format will be added in a future release.
:::

Sonda can detect and display warnings about dependencies installed in multiple versions. These warnings can help you identify potential issues in your project's dependencies, such as conflicting versions or unnecessary duplication.
