## 0.8.0

This is the biggest release of Sonda to date, featuring a complete rewrite of both the backend and frontend. The goals of this rewrite were to:

- Make it easier to inspect large projects with multiple outputs
- Display much more information about assets, inputs, external dependencies, and import relationships
- Significantly reduce the size of the HTML report files
- Prepare the codebase for future improvements and features

### Highlights

- **New HTML report design** – The report has been redesigned to improve navigation and clarity, especially for large projects with multiple outputs. See the [demo page](https://sonda.dev/demo) for an example.
- **New JSON report format** – The JSON format has been overhauled to better differentiate resource types and expose relationships between them. For details, refer to the [JSON report](https://sonda.dev/features/json-report.html) documentation.
- **ESM-only** – Sonda is now ESM-only and requires Node.js 20.19 or 22.12+. This change helps reduce the distribution size.
- **New output directory** – Reports are now saved to the `.sonda` directory and are prefixed with a unique number to avoid overwriting existing reports.

### Migration

If you're upgrading from version 0.7, you'll need to update your import paths and configuration.

#### Import Paths

Each integration now has its own import path. It's recommended to use the path specific to your framework or bundler, as these may include optimizations that improve performance and accuracy.

For example, if you're using Vite or Rolldown, use their dedicated import paths instead of the generic Rollup integration path.

Available import paths:

- `sonda/angular`
- `sonda/astro`
- `sonda/esbuild`
- `sonda/next`
- `sonda/nuxt`
- `sonda/rolldown`
- `sonda/rollup` (make sure that Sonda is at the top of the `plugins` array)
- `sonda/rspack`
- `sonda/sveltekit`
- `sonda/vite`
- `sonda/webpack`

#### Configuration

- The `filename` option has been removed and replaced with `outputDir`, which defaults to `.sonda`. All reports are saved to this directory, and filenames are prefixed with a unique number to prevent overwriting.
- The `detailed` option has been renamed to `deep`.

#### JSON Report

The JSON report format has been completely redesigned. For complete details, refer to the updated [JSON report](https://sonda.dev/features/json-report.html) documentation.

+ import Sonda from 'sonda/vite';
```

Please refer to the [Getting started](https://sonda.dev/getting-started.html) page for more information.

Sonda now has integrations for the following frameworks:

- [Next.js](https://sonda.dev/frameworks/nextjs.html)

### Patch Changes

- a64e6d8: Update README.md to include information about the new `detailed` configuration option.

## 0.2.0

Besides the new features listed below, this release changes some default behaviors. Now, sonda will not read external source maps or calculate file sizes after compression with GZIP and Brotli. If you want to use these features, use the following new configuration options:

```json
{
  "detailed": true,
  "gzip": true,
  "brotli": true
}
```

Please refer to README.md for more information.

### Minor Changes

- Add switch to toggle between uncompressed, GZIP, and Brotli treemap diagrams.
- Do not read dependency source maps by default. Use the `detailed` configuration option to read them.
- Update modal for assets to display how much code comes from ESM, CJS, or unknown sources.
- Improve GZIP and Brotli compression size estimations instead of showing worst-case sizes.
- Add modal for assets that displays the bundled, GZIP, and Brotli sizes.
- Update modal for assets to list external dependencies.
- Do not calculate GZIP and Brotli sizes by default. Use the `gzip` and `brotli` configuration options to calculate them.

### Patch Changes

- Correctly load source maps when `sourceMappingURL` contains URL params.
- Remove unnecessary `#__PURE__` comments.

## 0.1.4

- Show "No data to display" with a helpful message when there is no data to display in the report.
- Prevent black boxes in tree maps with large `[unassigned]` tiles.

## 0.1.3

## 0.1.2

- Use the `open` package to open the generated reports.

## 0.1.1

- Use `execFileSync` instead of `exec` to prevent potential shell injection when the path contains characters that the shell interprets in a special way, for instance quotes and spaces.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release of sonda that allowed generating an `'html'` and `'json'` report for bundles generated by Vite, Rollup, Webpack, and esbuild.
