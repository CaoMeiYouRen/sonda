* Update modal for assets to display how much code comes from ESM, CJS, or unknown sources.
* Add modal for assets that displays the bundled, GZIP, and Brotli sizes.
* Add switch to toggle between uncompressed, GZIP, and Brotli treemap diagrams.
* Improve GZIP and Brotli compression size estimations instead of showing worst-case sizes.
